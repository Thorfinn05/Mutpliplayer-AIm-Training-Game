## How to Play

1.  **Start a New Game:** Upon launching, you'll be prompted to select a difficulty level (Easy, Moderate, Hard). 🎮
2.  **Player Setup:** Choose the number of players (2-5) and enter each player's name. ✍️
3.  **Take Your Turn:** Each player gets a 30-second turn to click on as many appearing targets as possible. The goal is to click a target before it disappears. 💥
4.  **Dynamic Challenge:** As your turn progresses, and depending on the chosen difficulty, targets will disappear increasingly faster! 🚀
5.  **Turn Transitions:** After each player's turn, a transition screen will show the score of the just-finished player and indicate whose turn is next. ▶️
6.  **Game Over:** Once all players have completed their turns, the "Game Over" screen will display all final scores and declare the winner(s). 🎉
7.  **Replay:** You can choose to play again with the same players and settings or start a completely new game. 🔄
